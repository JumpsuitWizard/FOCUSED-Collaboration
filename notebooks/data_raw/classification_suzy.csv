AT&T,5/7/21,Telcom/operator is main revenue source (also media and tech services),software,Accelerant,Co-Leading,,,X,,,"I sense that AT&T sees investments as strategic around innovation. While os is central to scaling and reducing costs, execs probably see this most as enabling them to drive innovation in areas of greater value creation/capture. Leadership roles in key os foundations/alliances (Linux Foundation, Open Infrastructure Foundation, O-Ran Alliance)",,,,,,
SAIC,5/7/21,SAIC integrates multiple disciplines to provide their customers with resilient solutions that accommodate rapid improvements in technology,services,Accelerant,Combining,,,,,,SAIC gov't focused.

Vapor IO,5/7/21,edge computing infra,software,Accelerant,Co-Leading,,,,,,"Using os for trust, function, ecosystem development around their platform. Calling value Software - really unsure what's right here as it seems to be accelerant for combo of hardware/software/services  ",,,,,,
Comcast,5/7/21,dimensions here are for cable communications side of things ,xaas,Accelerant,Co-Leading,X,X,,,,"Very broad set of investments that support almost all areas of their business. financial support for numerous os orgs, significant contributions to CNCF, Apache, elsewhere. From high vantage point, feel their overall approach is accelerant: from open sourcing their internal tools to open sourcing key components that make their products and services run (many products very dependent), I think common relevance is it helps them get to value creation/capture more quickly, more innovation where there's genuine advantage. This is definintely a company where you'll hone in on a particular area and derive dimensions from that particular use case (e.g. content delivery network would be dependent as well as promotional)",https://comcast.github.io/,Yes,,,,
CapitalOne,5/7/21,"credit + consumer/commercial bank services, credit business is dominant",,Accelerant,Contribute,X,X,,,,"os seems mainly for resusable services. Hygieia DevOps dashboard story is interesting (from internal tool to a consortium of cross-industry users) and Cloud Custodian, work with Linux + Apache Foundations, Open API, CNCF.
